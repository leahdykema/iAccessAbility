                    <p>Facing technical issues can be frustrating, but you don’t have to handle them alone. I provide comprehensive tech support and problem-solving services to help you resolve issues quickly and efficiently. Whether it’s troubleshooting software, configuring settings, or addressing accessibility concerns, I offer personalized assistance tailored to your specific challenges. With a strong foundation in IT support and accessibility solutions, I am always expanding my knowledge to stay current with the latest technologies and provide you with the most effective solutions. My goal is to get your devices up and working smoothly again.</p>

                    <h2>Buying Consulting</h2>
                    <p>Whether you’re an artist, author, gamer, student, or simply seeking a reliable device, I offer personalized buying recommendations tailored to your specific needs and budget. The latest or most expensive option isn’t always the right choice for everyone, and that’s perfectly fine. Different devices are designed with different users in mind, and I’m here to help you identify the best fit for your unique requirements.</p>
                    <p>My consulting services are available via phone, text, or email. I recommend starting with an initial phone call, after which I will provide a detailed follow-up email that includes personalized product recommendations and links to the best places to purchase them.</p>

                    <h2>One-on-One Training</h2>
                    <p>Whether you’re new to technology or looking to enhance your skills, my one-on-one training sessions are designed to provide personalized guidance at your own pace. From mastering device basics to exploring advanced features, I tailor each session to your specific needs and goals. With a focus on accessibility and ease of use, I help you build the confidence and knowledge to get the most out of your devices. As I continuously expand my expertise in the latest tech, you’ll benefit from up-to-date training that empowers you to navigate your technology with ease.</p>
                    <p>My one-on-one training sessions can be conducted in-person,&#42; via Zoom or FaceTime, or through text via your phone number or WhatsApp. If in-person training isn’t an option, I recommend using FaceTime for a more interactive experience since texting is not the preferred method of communication for training purposes.</p>
                    <p class="notations">&#42;In-person training sessions are available exclusively in Pella, IA, due to transportation limitations.</p>
