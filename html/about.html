            <p>Welcome to the iAccessAbility website&#33; My name is Leah Dykema&#44; the creator behind the iAccessAbility YouTube channel&#44; formerly known as AppleTalk&#46; A bit about my background&#58; I was born in Xiamen City&#44; in the provance of Fujian in China with a rare genetic condition called albinism&#46; I spent the first 3 Â½ years of my life in an orphanage before being adopted and brought to the United States&#46;</p>
            <p>I&#39;m the youngest of four siblings&#46; I have two older brothers who are both married with kids and an older sister in college&#46; Growing up in a homeschooling family&#44; we stayed active and involved in a variety of activities&#46; I&#39;ve participated in swimming&#44; dance&#44; track and field&#44; bowling&#44; and even a Paralympic sport called Goalball&#46;</p>
            <p>My journey to independence with visual impairment has been supported by the Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired&#44; where I&#39;ve made incredible friends and met wonderful trainers through training sessions&#44; weekend sports retreats&#44; and camps&#46; I also learned Braille with the help of the Iowa Department for the Blind&#44; and I now use it to type on my phone &#8209; here&#39;s a demo of how I do that: <a href="https://youtu.be/WFjDI3yRCxs?si=tufIcFiEVBekSRCc">How to Use Braille Screen Input on an iPhone or iPad - YouTube</a></p>
            <img class="leah-collection" src="../img/leah-collection.PNG" alt="A picture of Leah Dykema kneeling on the floor by a desk with her Apple collection arranged to be displayed. She wears a t-shirt with symbals of Apple products across it.">
            <p>I&#39;ve been an Apple fan&#44; collector&#44; and user since I was 9 years old&#44; with the iPad and iPhone being my primary devices&#46; Since 2017&#44; iPads have been my essential tools for reading&#44; writing&#44; drawing&#44; watching content&#44; creating art&#44; and more&#46; My passion for technology and curiosity have driven me to become self&#8209;taught&#44; with YouTube playing a big role in expanding my knowledge&#46;</p>
            <p>I find it easiest to read with inverted colors&#44; like the white text on a black background you see here&#46; Simple fonts&#44; such as Arial or Helvetica&#44; in larger&#44; bold styles&#44; improve my readability&#46; Because I&#39;m sensitive to light&#44; white backgrounds can be overwhelming&#44; often washing out content and leading to eye strain&#46; Even small white areas&#44; like a line or image&#44; can reduce the visibility of the entire screen for me&#46;</p>
            <p>I created the AppleTalk YouTube channel in September 2020 to help people maximize their productivity with Apple products&#46; Prior to that&#44; from 2018 to 2020&#44; I made weekly 20 to 30-minute tutorials for a small group of friends&#44; which I shared via Google Drive&#46; In early 2024&#44; I rebranded to iAccessAbility and shifted my focus to sharing my knowledge of Apple accessibility as a visually impaired person with albinism&#46; My goal is to eventually vlog about my life as a visually impaired albino while continuing to provide helpful tips&#44; tricks&#44; and tutorials for the blind and visually impaired community&#46;</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting iAccessAbility and learning a bit more about my journey&#46; My mission is to empower individuals with visual impairments by sharing my experiences&#44; tips&#44; and accessibility knowledge&#46; I hope to inspire others to embrace their unique challenges and use technology to enhance their lives&#46; Stay connected&#44; and feel free to reach out if you ever have questions or need guidance on navigating the world of Apple products with accessibility features&#46; Be sure to checkout the rest of the site and the many resources around&#33;</p>
