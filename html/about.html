            <p>Welcome to the iAccessAbility website&#33; My name is Leah Dykema&#44; the founder of the iAccessAbility YouTube channel&#44; formerly known as AppleTalk&#46;</p>
            <p>A bit about me&#58; I was born in the city of Xiamen City&#44; in the provance of Fujian in China with a rare genetic condition called albinism&#46; I spent the first 3 Â½ years of my life in an orphanage before being by a Christian American couple.&#46; I&#39;m the youngest of four kids&#46; I have two older brothers who are now both married with kids and an older sister in college&#46; Growing up in a homeschooling family&#44; we stayed active and involved in a variety of activities&#46; I&#39;ve participated in swimming&#44; dance&#44; track and field&#44; bowling&#44; and even a Paralympic sport called Goalball&#46; In my free time&#44; I have enjoyed a variety of different hobbies such as cardistry&#44; origami&#44; and <a href="https://rainbowloom.com/">Rainbow Loom <sup>&#174;</sup></a> bracelet weeving&#46; I currently enjoy reading&#44; leisure writing&#44; digital art&#44; animating&#44; developing my website and coding skills&#44; and keeping up in the tech news on social media&#46;</p>
            <img class="leah-collection" src="../img/leah-collection.PNG" alt="A picture of Leah Dykema kneeling on the floor by a desk with her Apple collection arranged to be displayed. She wears a t-shirt with symbals of Apple products across it.">
            <p>I&#39;ve been an Apple fan&#44; collector&#44; and user since I was 9 years old&#44; with the iPad and iPhone being my primary devices&#46; Since 2017&#44; iPads have been my essential tools for reading&#44; writing&#44; drawing&#44; watching content&#44; creating art&#44; and so much more&#46; My passion for technology and curiosity have driven me to become self&#8209;taught&#44; with YouTube and Google playing a huge role in expanding my knowledge&#46;</p>
            <p>My journey to independence with visual impairment has been supported by the Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired &#40;IESBVI&#41;&#44; where I&#39;ve made incredible friends and met wonderful trainers through training sessions&#44; weekend sports retreats&#44; and camps&#46; I also learned Braille with the help of the Iowa Department for the Blind &#40;IDB&#41;&#44; and I now use it to type on my phone &#8209; here&#39;s a demo of how I do that: <a href="https://youtu.be/WFjDI3yRCxs?si=tufIcFiEVBekSRCc">How to Use Braille Screen Input on an iPhone or iPad - YouTube</a> IESBVI and IDB continue to help provide training and guidance for me as I prepare for the next stage in life entering adulthood&#46; I have learned so much with them and have met so many new people at the various camps and weekend sporting trips I have gone on through these groups&#46;</p>
            <p>With albinism&#44; I am extremely sensitive to light, so I find it easiest to read with white text on a black background&#46; Simple fonts&#44; such as Arial or Helvetica&#44; in larger&#44; bold styles&#44; are a must due to my dyslexia and visual impairment&#46; Because I&#39;m sensitive to light&#44; white backgrounds can be overwhelming&#44; often washing out content and leading to eye strain&#46; Even small white areas&#44; like a line or image&#44; can reduce the visibility of the entire screen for me&#46; But because I see light first before anything else&#44; I see screens right away&#46; Over the years&#44; I&#39;ve studied devices and have developed an ability to identify any iPhone and iPad at a glance&#44; which I enjoy showing off or using to help provide help to others&#46;</p>
            <p>In 2018 I was asked to share weekly tips for a friend at my church&#46; I uploaded and shared my weekly 20 to 30 minute videos through Google Drive until I created the AppleTalk YouTube channel in September of 2020&#46; In early 2024&#44; I rebranded to iAccessAbility and shifted my focus to sharing my knowledge of Apple accessibility as a visually impaired person with albinism&#46; My goal is to eventually vlog about my life as a visually impaired albino while continuing to provide helpful tips&#44; tricks&#44; and tutorials for the blind and visually impaired community to maximize usibility of technology&#46;</p>
            <p>In the fall of 2024&#44; I took an online graphic and web design class where I learned how to create websites using HTML&#44; CSS&#44; and JavaScript&#46; While taking that class&#44; I began developing the iAccessAbility website and in early 2025 bought the <a href="https://iaccessabilityservices.com">iaccessabilityservices&#46;com</a> domain&#46; The website has and will continue to be an ongoing project as I develop it and add to it in various ways to provide more resources and better accessibility for visitors&#46;</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting iAccessAbility and learning a bit more about my journey&#46; My mission is to empower individuals with visual impairments by sharing my experiences&#44; tips&#44; and accessibility knowledge&#46; I hope to inspire others to embrace their unique challenges and use technology to enhance their lives&#46; Stay connected&#44; and feel free to reach out if you ever have questions or need guidance on navigating the world of Apple products with accessibility features&#46; Be sure to checkout the rest of the site and the many resources around&#33;</p>
